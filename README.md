# Typescript Project

## Instructions

Define an interface named Vehicle with the following properties:
* make of type string
* model of type string
* year of type number
* start method which returns void and logs "Engine started" to the console.
* Implement a class named Car that implements the Vehicle interface. The Car class should have:
1. A constructor that initializes the make, model, and year properties.
1. Implement the start method to log "Car engine started" to the console.
1. Create an instance of the Car class and initialize it with some values for make, model, and year.
1. Call the start method on the instance of the Car class to verify that it logs the appropriate message to the console.
1. Finally, compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript and run it to ensure everything works as expected.
